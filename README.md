## 🧠 Vision

VaultX is an **enterprise-grade banking system** built using **Spring Boot + Java Concurrency**, designed to replicate real-world banking operations with high security, concurrency safety, and scalability.

> The goal: Build a full-stack banking system that’s secure, concurrent, and future-ready with AI-driven capabilities.

## 🚀 Current Progress

✅ **Sign-Up Flow**  
→ Secure registration with password hashing  
→ Auto-generated unique account number  
→ Real-time OTP verification using **Twilio Sandbox API**

✅ **Transaction Engine**  
→ Deposit, Withdraw, and Transfer implemented  
→ Validation for balance, account, and transaction limits  
→ Concurrency handled using `synchronized` blocks  
→ Proper exception handling for every failure scenario

✅ **Security Layer (Base)**  
→ Password hashing (BCrypt planned)  
→ JWT-based authentication (partially designed)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|:--|:--|
| Language | **Java (17+)** |
| Framework | **Spring Boot (upcoming)** |
| Database | **H2 / MySQL (planned)** |
| OTP Service | **Twilio API (sandbox)** |
| Authentication | **JWT (in progress)** |
| Concurrency | **Java Threads + Synchronization** |
| Build Tool | **Maven** |
| UI | **React / Thymeleaf (future)** |

## 🧩 System Design (Phase 1)

- **User Onboarding:** Fill signup form → Password hashed → Auto account number → OTP verified → Account activated  
- **Login:** Email + Password → Verify → JWT token (planned)  
- **Dashboard:** Shows current balance and 3 latest transactions  
- **Transactions:** Deposit | Withdraw | Transfer → balance validation, concurrency safety, and record saved  
- **Logging:** Every operation recorded for debugging and audit trails

## 🔜 Roadmap

- [ ] Spring Boot REST API layer (Controllers, DTOs, Services)
- [ ] Database integration (JPA/Hibernate)
- [ ] JWT authentication
- [ ] High-value transaction OTP verification
- [ ] Frontend UI for dashboard and transfers
- [ ] Custom exception handling with global error mapping
- [ ] Agentic AI for spending insights / fraud detection
